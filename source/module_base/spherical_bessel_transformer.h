//! A class to perform spherical Bessel transforms.
/*!
 *  The spherical Bessel transform of a function F(x) is defined as
 *
 *                               / +inf     2
 *          G(y) = sqrt(2/pi) *  |      dx x  F(x) j (y*x)
 *                               /  0               l
 *
 *  where
 *
 *          j 
 *           l
 *
 *  is the l-th order spherical Bessel function of the first kind.
 *
 *  This class interprets the input array as
 *
 *                   p
 *          in[i] = x [i] F(x[i])   (p being an input argument)
 *
 *  and, on finish, fills the output array with
 *
 *          out[j] = G(y[j])   or  out[j] = dG(y[j])/dy
 *
 *  Usage1:
 *
 *      // FFT-based method
 *
 *      SphericalBesselTransformer sbt;
 *
 *      // Default FFTW planner flag is FFTW_ESTIMATE
 *      // which is suitable for handling tasks of different sizes.
 *      sbt.radrfft(0, 2000, ...);
 *      sbt.radrfft(1, 3000, ...);
 *      sbt.radrfft(2, 4000, ...);
 *
 *      // The following flag leads to optimized FFT algorithms at the cost of
 *      // introducing large overhead during planning the FFTs.
 *      sbt.set_fftw_plan_flag(FFTW_MEASURE)
 *
 *      // FFTW plan is created at the first run
 *      // and reused for consecutive same-sized transforms.
 *      sbt.radrfft(0, 5000, ...);
 *      sbt.radrfft(1, 5000, ...);
 *      sbt.radrfft(2, 5000, ...);
